	"overthrow_brief_description"					"Hero Line Wars is a custom gamemode about running the enemy team out of lives by sending creeps their way. When a creep hits their base, they will lose one life."
	"overthrow_game_info_throne"					"Click creeps on the creep bar to spawn them."
	"overthrow_game_info_coins"						"Every 10 seconds your income will be given to you. Your income is increased for each creep you spawn, and higher level creeps give a higher income."
	"overthrow_game_info_items"						"Use your assigned controller to cast powerful spells to disrupt the enemy. Your assigned controller is located on your team's island near the center of the map."

	"overthrow_game_info_tips_header"				"Tips:"
	"overthrow_game_info_tip01"						"• Use <font color='#FFB300'>glyph</font> to stun and knock back enemy creeps."
	"overthrow_game_info_tip02"						"• Lower level creeps give more <font color='#FFB300'>income per gold spent.</font>"
	"overthrow_game_info_tip03"						"• Watch out for the <font color='#FF0000'>sudden death</font> phase. The <font color='#FF0000'>sudden death</font> phase starts 20 minutes into the game and sets each teams' lives to 1."
	"overthrow_game_info_tip04"						"• <font color='#0BE000'>Right-clicking</font> a creep button buys as many of that creep as possible."
	"overthrow_game_info_tip05"						"• If the <font color='#0BE000'>income</font> or <font color='#0BE000'>creep</font> bar is getting in the way, you can press the <font color='#0BE000'>collapse button</font> on each to hide or move it."
	"overthrow_game_info_tip06"						"• Moving your controller (the wizard courier) to the stone on your team's island gives your courier <font color='#34C9FA'>mana</font> at the cost of <font color='#FFCC00'>gold</font>."
	"overthrow_game_info_tip07"						"• Use the <font color='#0BE000'>Control Group Tab</font> keybind to quickly switch unit selection."
